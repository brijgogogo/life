## Calculating overtones

To calculate the nth harmonic, you multiply the fundamental frequency by n.
i.e.

```
1st = 440
2nd = 880 (440 * 2)
3rd = 1320 (440 *3)
etc...
```

## Waves

### Sine

The most pure, only has a fundamental frequency, no extra harmonics.

## Noise

### Pink

## Questions?

- What's the difference between a partial and a harmonic?
    - A partial includes the fundamental and all subsequent harmonics, a
      harmonic is the specific overtone.
