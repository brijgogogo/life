Rambles about my patches and my journey of pure data.

## Resources

- [pure data floss](http://write.flossmanuals.net/pure-data/introduction2/)

## Recording the videos

I use `simplescreenrecorder` for recording the videos. Set its output to JACK (to match puredata's). It works fine with i3wm.
On top of this, I have to upload the video to google drive so I can download it to my phone (not joking).

## Directory structure

Each patch has its own directory. Within that are the following:

- `ideas.md` - Brainstorming the patch
- `README.md` - The write-up of the patch once the patch has been created
- 'nth-patch.pd' - Where n is first, second, third etc... This is the patch
  itself.
