# Envy

```
I am everything that encompasses evil
I grow larger by the day

I send out vague riddles to make your brain wriggle
and devour you if you come my way

I am not a Sphinx, merely a felonous feline whose 
wretched deeds are trivial yet consume most of your time

I am here to make your life a misery
Pray on every insecurity and character flaw that you possess
until it's impossible to have any form of synergy

I will age you with rage
Make you believe you are free with your mind chained in a cage for not knowing how to
behave

I will take every route possible to activate your insecurities because there's no
better feeling than you being as unsure as me

I will enjoy the time we spend together since you're so malleable and easy to
convince that even the wrong words will make you wince

I will break down any symptoms of fortitude to the point that you're not sure
what to do and every image in your head is warped and the stories misconstrued

I am everything that is wrong with you
I know you better than you know you
You know this to be true because I am you
```

# Woman

```
You are my deity
Etched in wirings of my brain

Your very aura acts upon my acts of altruism
redacting any likeliness of a forming schism

You are divinity
Breaking down preconceptions in my mind

Your very being conquers preconceived notions
built from the misconceptions of uninformed persons 
wandering aimlessly through an ignorant ocean

You are beauty
A thing that will fade but has sculpted a character stronger than any marble

Emanating elegance, destroying irreverance and binding any wrongdoers to penance

You are a lifegiver
A gift that only half will receive and only a tenth deserve

Bearing the fruit of birth and praying that the seeds you plant realise their
own selfworth

You are you
An individual whose impact should not be confused, misconstrued or told to be
untrue

For as long as there is a believer in your person
there is a believer in you
```
