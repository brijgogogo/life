You know those recordings where they hit a bad note but didn't mean to but still
it made it onto the recording and gives you some faith that it's played by a
human? This is a list of those (and other hiccups).

Aaron Parks - Lilac 1:59 (Pianist hits a dud note on a fill)

AFI - Girls Not Grey 1:09 (Guitarist in the right channel hits an open B)

David Grisman (With Tony Rice) - 0:47 - Wildwood Flower (Guitarist plays a bad note)

NOFX - 100 Times Fuckeder 1:27 (Vocalists voice breaks on the word 'Dismissed')

Red Hot Chili Peppers - Give It Away 3:32 (Bassist slides over the target note)

Slayer - Disciple 2:29 (Dodgy cut in the actual recording, maybe this is just Spotify's version though, it skips very slightly)
