A list of various programming ideas that I may or may not pursue at some point.

- [[Music command line tool]] - A command line interface for viewing various music theory things
- [[musicss]] - A CSS framework for music notation
- [[Social Hacks ]] - A website aimed at being a central pool where people can submit things that *need* to be programmed
      which would help the world...basically. It's like RHOK before RHOK for some reason turned into a weekly hackathon
- Open Game Music V2 - Similar to my previous attempt. except built ontop of Laravel.
- [[Interactive Apache]] - Learn How to configure and use Apache through the command line.  Pretty much like githug but for Apache.
