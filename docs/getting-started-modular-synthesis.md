# Modular Synthesis

List of things you'll need and recommendations.

## Rack

Go for a eurorack format, it seems like the most common and is fairly cheap.

Two good possible options for a rack/case are

- [TipTop Audio's happy ending kit](http://www.tiptopaudio.com/hek.php)
- [Doepfer A-100](http://www.proaudioeurope.com/keyboards/modular-synths/doepfer-a-100lc3-raw-wooden-case.html)

They both have the same capabilities (powered and 84hp)
